OK THIS IS COMPLEX LISTEN UP.
THIS IS HOW WE MAKE THE ICONS

we need to do the following steps:

- get all the part name from the browser.
- match them up with the asset exported from spine
- make a hashmap of paths that we can read.

1. console.log in the browser should shit out all the parts
2. right click on it, press 'copy object' and past it into the spine-names.js
3.
